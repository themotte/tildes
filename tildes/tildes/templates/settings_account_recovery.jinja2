<p>In order to support account recovery while maximizing user privacy, Tildes's recovery process is a bit unusual.</p>

<p>The email address you enter below will be cryptographically hashed (using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2">Argon2</a>) and only the hash stored. <strong>Your actual address is not stored</strong>, so it is impossible for anyone to see what it is or use it to send you email, and your address can't be leaked (due to a data breach, account compromise, etc.).</p>

<p>Because of this, the account recovery process has to be initiated differently from most sites:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If you lose access to your account, send an email from the associated address to <a href="mailto:{{ pass_email }}">{{ pass_email }}</a>, requesting a password reset for that specific username.</li>
  <li>The sending email address is hashed, and if the result matches the stored hash for that user, a message is sent back (to the same address) that includes a password reset link.</li>
  <li>You receive the email, reset your password, and are able to log into the account again.</li>
</ol>

<p>This means that <strong>you must be able to both send and receive email with the address</strong>, so make sure to use an address where you can do both.</p>

<p>Finally, since even you won't be able to see which email address is attached to the account in the future, there is a space for you to leave a short description of the address in case you forget which one it is. <strong>Please don't include the actual address in the description</strong>, or use a description that makes it obvious what the address is. I don't want to know your email address. Seriously.</p>
